uniparser-grammar-eastern-armenian
==================================

This is a formalized description of standard Eastern Armenian morphology, which also includes a number of oral and historical elements. The description is carried out in the UniParser format and includes a list of paradigms (paradigms.txt) and a grammatical dictionary (hye-lexemes-XXX.txt files). The dictionary contains descriptions of individual lexemes, each of which is accompanied by information about its stem, its part-of-speech tag and some other grammatical information, its inflectional type (paradigm), and, for some items, English translation.
